# Diamond Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting diamond prices based on key features like cut, color, clarity, carat, and depth. Users can interact with a user-friendly webpage to select desired characteristics for a diamond, and the model will forecast the price in Indian Rupees.

## Objectives

1. **Accurate Price Prediction**
   - Use machine learning to predict the price of diamonds based on multiple features.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Provide an interactive web application for users to input diamond characteristics.

3. **Educational Insights**
   - Help users understand the factors affecting diamond pricing.

## Usage

1. Open the web application.
2. Input the desired features for the diamond (e.g., cut, color, carat, etc.).
3. Click "Predict" to get the price in Indian Rupees.
4. View detailed insights on how the features influenced the prediction.

## Dataset
- The model uses a dataset containing real-world diamond characteristics and their prices.
- Data preprocessing includes cleaning, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

---

## Model Training

1. **Load the Dataset**
   - Prepare the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets.

2. **Train the Model**
   - Use regression techniques such as Linear Regression or Random Forest.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**
   - Validate performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
